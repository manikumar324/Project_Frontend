You can see the project LIVE at :- https://online-food-website-rtg5.onrender.com

The Project name is ONLINE FOOD RESTAURANT WEBSITE 

I used React.js , Node.js , Express.js , Mongo db , Bootstrap and some other technologies & Libraries to make this project.
This Project is used to order the food items in our website instead of standing in a Quee for food tokens and Billing.
In this project I created Sign in & Log in pages for the User Authentication and Listed some food items to make the order by clicking the butoon "Order Now"
or else you can see some more recipies regarding the item by clicking the button "View More".
I also created a Order Form for the user to order the item by filling the required information like Address , mobile number e.t.c.
